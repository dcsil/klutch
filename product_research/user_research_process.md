# User Research Process :sparkles:

## Find suitable set of test users

Due to the simple nature of our current user journey, we can use feedback from a wide range of users that might not exactly match our end user (nurses) but can still provide valuable feedback regardless.

Our test set should contain users with some combination of the following criteria:

- Must be more than 5 users
- Must have a diverse set of ages represented (to simulate nurses from different age groups)
- Preferably University educated
- Preferably involved in healthcare

## Conduct usability testing on the set of test users
This is our current process for each user testing session:

1. Ask for their consent to share and use their feedback and or any other recorded information.
2. Give each user a list of tasks (mentioned below) to complete on the Invision prototype mock-up
3. Make the user think aloud when performing each task
4. Document feedback (ie. take notes during the session, video record their interactions on the mockup, voice record their feedback)
5. Conclude the session with a list of general feedback questions.

### Current Tasklist
This is our task list based on our current [mockup](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main/default/#/console/18668440/388407307/preview):
1. Take a picture, view information processed from the picture, then send it to the Cerner server.
2. Take a picture, retake the picture, view information processed from the picture, then send to Cerner server.
4. Take a picture, view information processed from the picture, retake picture, then send to Cerner server.
4. repeat task 1 then try to take another picture.

## Analyze data collected from usability testing sessions
- Try to consolidate the feedback from the sessions and summarize the results.
- Brainstorm ways about how the mockup can be improved
- Create new action items
- Add new action items created to your roadmap
