## Market Landscape

We have decided to target the healthcare industry. Our product is a B2B solution that helps with facilitating the charting process within health facilities. We aim to market our product directly to hospitals that have already adopted Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in their facility. Since these hospitals already have the technology, we are going to sell our product as an add-on feature to make it easier for them to integrate it with their existing EMR system and easier for us to sell to hospitals.

## Market Opportunity


Hospitals are our main target customers, and our end users are nurses that interact most with the EMR system.

The problem we are trying to solve is related to a nurse's emergency procedure workflow. A nurse must document all of a patient's information by inputting data to an electronic chart (EMR). This manual data entry component makes
the process of documentation time-consuming and inefficient. 

Therefore, during emergencies, nurses would write down long and narrative notes about what they observed, and manually input whatever they have written into the hospital’s electronic medical record (EMR) system after the emergency is over.

 A personal statement from a hospital neonatal nurse (our subject matter expert) has confirmed this to be laborious and unbelievably inefficient. In our interview, she mentions the following:


> Right now if an emergency situation happens, I scramble to find a blank piece of paper and scratch down in chicken scratches what’s happening. After the situation occurs, I have to try not to lose the dumbass piece of paper and transfer the chicken scratches to the actual places in the charting system where everything is supposed to go, which takes forever.

It was estimated that nurses spend between 2-4 hours charting out of their 12 hour shifts. The opportunity cost of not making this process more efficient is massive.
 Therefore, our aim is to let nurses spend more time where it counts the most: taking care of patients.

Our product will be an application that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert nurses' handwriting into machine-encoded text. Additionally, we will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to retrieve meaningful information from this digital document and input them automatically to the hospital's EMR system.
 Since different hospitals have different EMRs, we've decided to target one EMR, Cerner, for our MVP.

 The reason why we chose Cerner was because our subject matter expert works with Cerner. This would be a great advantage for our user research. Also, Cerner has an API we can use to integrate our app with their platform, which would help with development.

 We believe our app will disrupt the EMR health app market because there currently aren't any OCR-based EMR systems that aim to solve the problem we are targeting.

 As for our team, Shawnee's Machine Learning expertise will help us when building NLP and OCR models. Andrea's security background will be an asset to building any health app, given how security must always be a top priority when dealing with patient information. Jemin's UX/UI experience will help us build a user-friendly, customer-facing app. And finally, Sonata's experience with app development will be important for the product's technical infrastructure. All in all, we have a strong lineup of technical expertise to develop our product in the market.

One thing our team lacks is that none of us have first-hand experience in the healthcare industry. We plan on mitigating this by conducting extensive user research along the way and consulting our subject matter experts regularly in the decision-making process.
