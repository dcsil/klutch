# Diversity in Klutch

The Canadian society is a mosaic of different backgrounds and cultures. This year’s theme, healthcare, affects everyone in that mosaic. This makes Klutch’s customer base incredibly diverse. Therefore, diversity is incredibly essential to have within our team and we value it immensely. In this document we will be expanding on how diversity is an integral part of Klutch’s team dynamic. We will also be discussing how our team lacks in terms of diversity and our plan to mitigate that knowledge gap with subject matter experts.


Team Background & Strengths
---

Coming all the way from Singapore, our first two members bring a global perspective to the team. As a Business Administration student, Jemin provides invaluable business expertise to Klutch, as well as a critical eye for UI/UX design. As a well-rounded individual, Jemin has participated in various sports competitions, which have honed his communication skills, ability to think on the spot, and endurance to remain calm under pressure.

His fellow Singaporean, Andrea, is our resident security expert who is trained in exposing security vulnerabilities on the web. Specializing in front end development, she always brings an open mind when working in teams, and is always willing to look into new ideas and different perspectives.

On the other side of the coin is Shawnee, whose expertise lies in low-level programming and firmware security. She has also taken an introductory course in Machine Learning, making her knowledge essential for this year’s theme. When it comes to maintaining team dynamics, Shawnee will be able to contribute through her leadership and conflict resolution skills from her proven track record of participating in multiple student organizations.

Finally, Sonata can provide her peers with an insight into the Canadian market while preserving a perspective of diversity stemming from her Syrian cultural background. As for her technical experience, she has spent the last 16 months working as a full stack developer with industry standard web technologies. During that time, she gained relevant experience by organizing team meetings and preparing demos.


## Weak Spots

Despite our team’s rich blend of cultural and technical backgrounds, we are still lacking in some key areas. For example, Klutch is launching in a Canadian market. However, we have limited Canadian business insight on the team due to our international background. Additionally, none of us have any prior experience in healthcare, so it would be challenging for us to identify the most current market trends and opportunities in the field. Therefore, we need to focus on bringing in health professionals that could provide a better outlook on the industry.
Our team also lacks some important soft skills. Primarily, we are a group of introverts. This could be perceived as a weakness in a startup setting, as we will constantly be put in situations that push us to break out of our comfort zone. Aside from this, we also face some key technical challenges. None of us have formal Machine Learning experience, which puts us at a slight disadvantage given our partner this year, Dessa. In addition, considering how large the mHealth market has become, we identified another shortcoming in our team’s lack of experience in mobile app development.

Aside from the lack of diversity in our technical expertise, it is also important for us to acknowledge other areas of diversity where we are lacking. For example, we fail to represent key demographics that interact with the Canadian healthcare system. Demographic diversity plays a critical role in the healthcare industry, as it can possibly save lives. Recent studies have shown that racial bias affects the Canadian healthcare system through the marginalization of the aboriginal communities in northern territories<sup>[[1]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/health-care-racial-bias-north-1.4731483 )</sup>. This is just one example where lack of diversity creates significant problems in the industry. As our product develops, we have to be aware of how it would affect all the customer segments within our target market. Therefore, we need to be considering customer demographics that do not currently exist in our team.


## Subject Matter Experts

In order to mitigate these gaps in our expertise, we are working to consult a number of subject matter experts throughout our market research and product development. Health professionals such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists will be able to provide us with invaluable insight into the healthcare industry. They will introduce us to the existing problem spaces in the Canadian market and provide guidance in developing products that cater to the customers’ needs. Furthermore, we are looking to bring in some Machine Learning experts to support us on the technical side of product development. Of course, our first point of contact would be our main partner, Dessa. However, we are also open to consulting other prospects such as university professors and graduate students who are conducting their research on the subject.


## Customer Diversity

Our team size limits our diversity. For example, Klutch consists of abled individuals which makes us lack the perspective of folks who have accessibility needs. Additionally, we also fail to represent another key customer group in healthcare, which are the seniors. If we are developing a product that highly values diversity, then we should be seeking the perspectives of people from all across communities (to the best of our abilities and resources). Klutch is therefore planning on diversifying our customer testing base by making sure that all key demographics from the Canadian market are considered. This must be implemented in order to avoid any possible blindspots that may exist in our product.


## How this can impact us

Bias in product design and development can be detrimental to the product’s success. Thus, we are actively trying to avoid biases by integrating diversity within our team. We are doing this by consulting subject matter experts as well as diversifying our customer testing base to include all possible demographics. We acknowledge that our product will not be perfect due to the limitations within our team, but we are actively committed to acknowledging customer feedback with the goal of making our product as inclusive as possible.
