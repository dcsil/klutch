## About Andrea

Andrea is a budding entrepreneur that enjoys poking around to find holes or pain points in life and exploit them by either creating applications or investigating how certain sites work. A Singaporean, she moved to Canada to intern at ecobee - a home automation startup - where she works as a security developer under a school program known as NUS Overseas Colleges. Comfortable with full-stack development and general web security, she looks forward to contribute intensively and learn more about the business side of entrepreneurship.

## Strengths

- Capable of innovating ideas on the fly
- Fairly capable of poking holes and finding pain points and vulnerabilities
- Adept at web development

## Weaknesses

- Has a roundabout way of coding (which might not be effective)
- Rather awkward when presenting in front of large group
- Have a bad habit of asking for help only when its too late
